I started playing the violin when I was seven years old, and grew up in a rich folk music environment at Fron in Gudbrandsdalen. Since then, via studies and meetings with many sorts of people, I have played and composed music in between different styles, being traditional, improvised, baroque and contemporary expressions.

I seek interplay. To investigate what occurs when two or more characters work together on the same level. I am active in several bands. 

I am allured by music that in one way or another have qualities one will find in, and here I have to use a difficult concept, «nature». Through developing extended techniques on the violin and observing tonalities and rhythms in our surroundings, I try to absorb such ideas in my own playing. My music can sometimes sound post-electronic, but it is by all means inspired by pre-technological times.
